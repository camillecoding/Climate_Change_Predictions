## Self-Assessment
During the course of this project, my main role was creating and maintaining our database in PostgreSQL. In this role, I extracted the raw datasets, transformed them using Pandas, and loaded them into our database using SQLAlchemy. While in Zoom sessions, I advised the team on how to replicate this database on their own machines as well as how to read in tables from the database for use in the machine-learning model and other Jupyter Notebooks.

Additionally, I took on the responsibility of creating two of our interactive visualizations. Utilizing Plotly in Python, I generated two world maps, one showing carbon emissions by country and the other displaying average annual surface temperatures by country. This was probably my biggest challenge during the final project. I was completely unfamiliar with the process of adding a time slider to a Plotly visualization, and had to consult multiple online resources to piece together the code needed to correctly render the map.

## Team Assessment
For this project, We decided to work asynchronously as much as possible, providing updates to each other in a group Slack. We met on Mondays and Wednesdays via Zoom, where we thought through any challenges we were facing and created a plan to address them. We each had our own branch in this repo where we pushed updates.

I thought every member of the team was very good at pivoting their roles and taking on anything that the project called for. While at times I felt that we were focusing on the wrong issues during our Zoom sessions, we all took interest in the other team members' roles and were very in-sync.
