# Project Untitled
This project aims to use past CO2 emissions data up until 2018 to predict future (2019 and 2020) emissions - then uses a machine learning model to test our hypothesis. We believe that our prediction will be accurate in 2019 and inaccurate in 2020, since 2020 was a novel year.  

The team is comprised of Brandon, Kat, Steven, and Camille.

### Team Communication Protocols ###
We've decided to work asynchronously as much as possible, providing updates to each other in a group Slack. We meet on Mondays and Wednesdays via Zoom, where we think through any challenges we're facing and create a plan to address them. We each have our own branch in this repo where we push updates and may create separate repositories on our own accounts to create first drafts of code.
