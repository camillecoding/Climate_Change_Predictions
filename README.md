# project

X-role: I focused on the technology side of the project for Segment 1 of this project. Questions answered by me include: 

* Which tools are the best fit for your project? 
* What will be used for each section? 
* How will the dashboard be built?

All of these different components play a large part in project efficacy, so knowing them beforehand helps smooth the workflow.

For Segment 1, the technology.md file is uploaded to our main repo to convey the list of technologies our team intends to use for the project.
