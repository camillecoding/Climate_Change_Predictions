# Project 

## Deliverable 1

X-role: I focused on the technology side of the project for Segment 1 of this project. Questions answered by me include: 

* Which tools are the best fit for your project? 
* What will be used for each section? 
* How will the dashboard be built?

All of these different components play a large part in project efficacy, so knowing them beforehand helps smooth the workflow.

For Segment 1, the technology.md file is uploaded to our main repo to convey the list of technologies our team intends to use for the project.

## Deliverable 2

We each developed a blended role to complete segment 2 of this project. I honed in on map and plot creations to allow user interactivity with CO2 emissions data. 

Questions users may ask might be:

* How does one country compare to another with regards to CO2 emissions released?
* When did CO2 emissions begin to exponentially increase?

CO2 emissions data relies on the time variable. Undoubtedly, CO2 emissions have been increasing as time goes on. Thus, it's important to determine interactive maps and plots to display this data.

I created a map with a time slider using Plotly in R to display CO2 emissions data globally as reported over time with the click of a button, "Play". This subtle interactivity provides users with an easy understanding of CO2 emissions changes over time and helps to answer broad questions users may have regarding regional or time differences.
