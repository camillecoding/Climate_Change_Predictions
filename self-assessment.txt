# Individual Self-Assessment for Climate Change Project #

## Self-Assessment ##
I contributed to this project in a few key ways. After discussing a group interest on climate change, I sourced each of the datasets that would help us illustrate
our questions. I was very involved in team discussions and helped us narrow the many questions we originally wanted our dataset to answer down to the two-three main
questions we addressed in this project. My greatest challenge in this project was time management, as I had a heap of competing priorities to manage during the implementation
phase of our project. I had to prioritize and communicate with my team members, who were understanding of these circumstances. I worked around these challenges by
actively participating on our Monday/Wednesday meetings and helping my team debug code.

## Team Assessment ##
The team largely worked asynchronously and brought any questions to our Monday/Wednesday meetings. We maintained an active Slack channel, which helped us share resources
with one another. This method of communication was generally effective for us. If starting from scratch again, I would advocate for narrowing our project scope as early as possible
to potentially increase the number of interesting visualizations we could produce.

## Project Summary ##
Climate change is a salient issue for our planet, and we wanted to explore a topic that would reveal and predict global emissions trends. 
We were curious about predicting emissions through 2050 and how these projected emissions would impact global surface temperatures. By using several programming
languages, including Python, SQL, Javascript, and R, we were able to produce visualizations that indicate continuing trends.
